    1.4 WHY Digital Projects Fail?
    There are many reasons to fail Digital Projects,I wish to include some of them  like, (1)IN accurate requirements for exaample ,a case study: Qantas-In 2008,Qantas-Australias National  Airline cancelled its $4o million Jetsmart Project.To avoid this problem the company should involved all subject matter experts-business partners ,IT representatives,and even end users- during the requirements phase of a project.
    2: Uninvolved project sponsors: That means the developments happens but without involving just with stakes and handover the development teams without any representatives ,when question arise but they guess the wrong answer and it leads to failer or unhappy project sponsors.And the products that are not fit for release and the arise complication and overdue budget.
    3:Shifting project objectives,Every IT project has three constraints:time,scope and budget- Using Waterfall Approach,time,and scope are fixed,but budget are flexible.So the development team could not complete the projects on time due to lack of budget.
    4:Failure to account for business process.
    5: Failure to secure all executive buy-in and every one knows that failed projects has some serious critical problem.
    There are 2 solutions- get the CEO to mandate that digital transformation is a priority and bring the project under one umbrella Secondly map your project and identify what is the cause of the failure.
